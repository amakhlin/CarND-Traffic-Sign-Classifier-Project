# CarND Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classifier

## Problem Statement

This project uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. A network is trained so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, the model is tested on new images of traffic signs downloaded from the web.

## Implementation
The project implementation is located in the Jupter notebook called [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (Optional)
